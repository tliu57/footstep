Back to 2001, George Succi, Daniel Clapp and Robert Gampert brought up the idea that using the seismic amplitude distribution, such as kurtosis, to identify a footstep.(2) Later on in 2003, Houston and McGaffigan proposed a novel footstep detection algorithm using cadence features.Instead of the conventional approach of detecting transients corresponding to individual footfalls, they examined the use of spectrum analysis on envelope-detected seimic signals and got good results. Then, in 2006, Bland discussed the use of autoregressive (AR) coefficients in designing a footstep detection scheme from acoustic and seismic sensors. (3) Next in 2007, Dibazar et al. considered using geophones to detect seismic signals generated by footsteps and vehicles. Then in 2009, Subramanian et al.considered employing empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based signal processing scheme for the detection of footsteps.(5) As time goes by, more and more researches into this field had been conducted. In 2011, Thyagaraju Damarla and James Sabatier,from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory,presented work on developing an algorithms to detect and classify people walking and jogging based on the fact that when people are fast moving, their impact of a foot on the ground is higher, and a higher Doppler from an ultrasonic sensor can be observed.(6) And in 2012, Asif Mehmood and Thyagaraju Damarla implemented on seismic data to distinguish human footsteps from horse footsteps. 

As an expansion upon simple horse, person walking, person running classification, we collected data of adult walking, adult running, children walking, children running, dog walking and dog running. We worked on classifying different categories rather than solely walking or running.
