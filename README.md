# footstep
The repo contains almost everything we referenced, coded, implemented and reported when we tried to build up the system for footstep classification:
Datas folder contains all the original data we collected by using GS-One geophone sensors.
Meeting Notes are simply notes that marks our progresses and tasks in every meeting.
Reference_folder are the papers we actually quoted in our paper(final report).
Related papers are papers that we either get our inspiration from, or ideas we build our models or classifiers on.
Reports folder contains our proposal reports, status reports, and final reports.
src folder are matlab source code.

The system has to be run in matlab, and each classifiers should be run separately.
